  |   Cyber Protocol is an arcade puzzle game set in Cyberpunk scenario     |
  |   with a strong and dynamic gameplay. You impersonate the main hero,    |
  |   whose mission is to bring his Android friend (G0X6) back to life by   |
  |   activating the protocol.                                              |
  |                                                                         |

  |   The team has put every effort to turn each of 100 levels into a       |
  |   new, original challenge, not just with different setups, but also     |
  |   with new traps with different mechanics which could be used in        |
  |   various ways. The plan was that each time you go through a stage,     |
  |   you will get as involved as the first time.                           |
  |                                                                         |
